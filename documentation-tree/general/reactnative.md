# React Native Tests


### Test Types

NB: many of the tests from the [React](documentation-tree/general/react.md) section can also be applied to React Native (especially redux tests). Here are some examples of different approaches using `react-native-testing-library`

- [Component](../react/component.md)
- [Forms (`react hook form`)](../react/reacthookform.md)
- [Service (Not yet added)](../react/service.md)

### Mocking

- [General Mocking](../react/mocking/general.md)
- [Mocking Fetch](../react/mocking/fetch.md)

### React Native Tests

- [Component](../reactnative/component.md)
- [Navigation](../reactnative/navigation.md)
